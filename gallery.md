My stock portfolio, built in March of 2020 during the Coronavirus recession. I invested $400 and got 100% return on my investment. You wanna know how the rich get richer during a recession? Well, this is how they do it. I say if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

![Message to Senator Warren](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ejgmf63XkAAEi99?format=jpg&name=large)

Message I wrote to Senator Elizabeth Warren regarding the EARN IT Act. This bill threatens free speech on the Internet and sets a dangerous precedent for banning all strong cryptography. That means no VPNs, no HTTPS, no PGP, nothing. You'll have to do all your online banking in the clear, leaving you open to cyber-attacks. Yes, Bill Barr, the architect of this bill, has literally stated that his end goal is to ban all strong cryptography on the Internet. Hopefully when Biden wins (which he will), he'll do the right thing and show Bill Barr the door.

State diagram for part of the Turing machine I designed for parsing and validating CSV code. You can find the code for the Turing machine I wrote in the [libcsv repository](https://github.com/PsychoCod3r/libcsv). You can find a full description of the CSV Turing machine in [this article on my Wordpress](https://psychocod3r.wordpress.com/2020/09/30/data-science-in-c-programming-a-turing-machine-to-parse-csv-code/).
