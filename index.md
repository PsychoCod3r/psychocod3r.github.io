### About Me:

Hi, my name is Michael Warren. I'm a NEET suffering from schizoaffective disorder and high-functioning autism who lives in a government-subsidized group home for insane people and spends his inordinate free time working on coding projects from his room. I started coding in 2003 at the age of 14 with a TI-83 graphing calculator, which I would write simple programs on in TI-Basic. I then moved on to HTML and Javascript, played around with the Applescript feature on my family's iMac, and learned some basic C, though I never got my hands on a C compiler until years later. At the age of 19 and 20 I gave myself a more thorough education in front-end web development, then spent a few months learning the Unix CLI and all the programs and scripting languages that came with it, and then started doing some actual C programming with the gcc compiler. I love exploring different programming languages, operating systems, and software, and thus have experience with a number of languages and tools. I keep coming back to C because it can do basically anything.

### About My Work:

I am currently working on a collection of data science libraries for the C programming language. So far I have written libdfloat - a library for exact representation of decimal numbers in floating point format - and a partial implementation of libcsv - a library for serializing and deserializing CSV files and performing operations on CSV tables in the same way you would do in a relational database. libdfloat serves as the arithmetic underpinning of libcsv. My vision for these libraries is to provide a basic API for doing data science programming in C. I've always been bothered by the hyperfocus on Python as the de facto data science language, because there's really nothing special about that language and it also doesn't allow you to write your own algorithms. So I figured I'd shake up the status quo a bit and improve the repretoire of data science libraries for C (which as I understand are few and far between) so that C and C++, the languages that all those fancy machine learning algorithms are actually implemented in, can be seen as viable options for data science and artificial intelligence programming. I want to provide programming tools for people who want to do data science programming, but don't want to be restricted by Python's "It just werks!" approach that does all your thinking for you and doesn't give you the flexibility of designing your own algorithms.
